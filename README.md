# Next.js 15 Data Fetching Bug

This repository demonstrates a data fetching issue in a Next.js 15 application.  The `About` page attempts to fetch data from an API route (`/api/hello`), but occasionally fails to display the data correctly.

## Bug Description

The `About` page uses `useEffect` and `fetch` to retrieve data.  Intermittently, the page either shows a blank screen or throws an error instead of displaying the message from the API.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`.  Observe that the data may not always render properly.

## Potential Causes

* **Race conditions:**  The data fetching might be happening faster than the component rendering.
* **Asynchronous operations:** Issues with handling the asynchronous nature of the `fetch` call.
* **Missing error handling:** The code lacks comprehensive error handling for the `fetch` operation.

## Solution

The solution involves adding robust error handling and potentially improving the way data is handled and displayed.
